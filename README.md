# extract\_loop

**extract\_loop** is a streamlined tool for processing looped audio files to extract their looped sections and reduce unnecessary repetition. Built with Docker for ease of use and portability, it processes audio files in formats like MP3 and outputs the processed results efficiently.

## Features

- Automatically detects and extracts loops from audio files.
- Designed for simplicity and ease of use with Docker.
- Handles large audio files with minimal manual intervention.
- Configurable paths for input and output.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your system.
- Bash-compatible shell (e.g., `bash`, `zsh`).
- Basic familiarity with the command line.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Siiir/extract_loop.git
cd extract_loop
```

**Optional:** Build the Docker image manually:

```bash
./build_img
```

This step is optional. The `extract_loop` script will automatically handle building the Docker image if it is not already available.

This script builds the `extract_loop` Docker image and ensures all dependencies are installed.

## Usage

The `extract_loop`Â tool is designed to be run via the provided `extract_loop` script. This script handles Docker image {validation, building}, input/output path setup, and execution.

### Command

```bash
./extract_loop [input_file] [output_directory]
```

### Parameters

- `input_file` (optional): The path to the input MP3 file. Defaults to `input.mp3` in the script's directory.
- `output_directory` (optional): The path to the directory where processed files will be stored. Defaults to `output` in the script's directory.

### Examples

#### 1. Using Default Paths

If your input file is `input.mp3` in the same directory as the script, and you want the output in the `output` folder:

```bash
./extract_loop
```

#### 2. Specifying Input and Output Paths

Specify an input file and an output directory:

```bash
./extract_loop /path/to/input.mp3 /path/to/output
```

#### 3. Help Message

To see usage information:

```bash
./extract_loop --help
```

## Development

This repository includes the following key scripts:

- `build_img`: Builds the Docker image required to run the tool.
- `extract_loop`: Runs the tool inside a Docker container.

### Testing

To test the tool, provide sample MP3 files and verify that the output matches the expected extracted loop.

### Cleaning Up

To remove the `extract_loop` Docker image:

```bash
docker rmi extract_loop
```
